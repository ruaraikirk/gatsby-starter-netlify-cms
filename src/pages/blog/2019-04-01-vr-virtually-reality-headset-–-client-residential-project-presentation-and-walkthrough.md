Well, not only because it is fun! Collaborative Design Office offers our clients Virtually Reality in the early design stage because it also enables the client to envision the concept of the project, its spaces, size, scale, light, textures and finishes.

We recently took our clients on a tour through each space of there future new home in virtual reality. Exploring the different rooms, experiencing the concept of bring the natural light down into different spaces, colour palettes, textures, finishes and even rooftop views. A very enjoyable experience for both clients and architect giving us the confidence the we have fulfilled our clients brief.  

Collaboration and interaction are the philosophy of our practice.
